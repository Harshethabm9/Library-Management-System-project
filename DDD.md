## Domain Driven Design 

### Identify Domains:

  Library Domain:
                 - Responsible for managing the library, available books, and book transactions.
                 - Includes the Library class.
  
  Student Domain:
                 - Represents the actions and information related to students borrowing, returning, and donating books.
                 - Includes the Student class.
                 
   Tracking Domain:
                 - Manages the tracking of book transactions, such as books borrowed by students.
                 -Includes the Track class.

### Strategic Design:

     Core Domain (Library):
                 - Manages the core functionality of the library, including book management and transactions.
                 - The Library class encapsulates the core domain.
                 
     Supporting Domains (Student and Track):
                 - The Student class supports the core domain by handling user interactions related to books (requesting, returning, donating).
                 - The Track class supports the core domain by tracking book transactions (issued books).

We can few more domain in this DDD like User Domain, Inventory Domain and Transaction Domain.

      User Domain:
                - Manages user-related functionality such as user authentication, roles, and profiles.
                - Responsible for user registration, login, and access control.

      Inventory Domain:
                - Handles the inventory of the library, including tracking book quantities, categories, and availability.
                - Manages the replenishment and depletion of book stock.

      Transaction Domain:
                - Tracks library transactions, including book borrowings, returns, and donations.
                - Maintains a history of user interactions with the library.

Now, let's modify the existing code to accommodate these additional domains. 
  
- User Domain
  
              class User:
                  def __init__(self, username, password, role):
                      self.username = username
                      self.password = password
                      self.role = role
- Inventory Domain
  
              class Inventory:
                  def __init__(self):
                      self.books = []
              
                  def add_book(self, book):
                      self.books.append(book)
              
                  def remove_book(self, book):
                      self.books.remove(book)

  - Transcation Domain
 
              class Transaction:
                def __init__(self, user, book, transaction_type):
                    self.user = user
                    self.book = book
                    self.transaction_type = transaction_type
                    self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()

The update DDD Strategic Design for these domain will be
