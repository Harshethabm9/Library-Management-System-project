## 5. DDD (Domain Driven Design)

In domain-driven design (DDD), domains within a system are identified and arranged, the core domain is highlighted, and a strategy design outlining the interactions and mappings between these domains is created. We may find possible domains in the code that is supplied, develop a strategic design, and then document it.

## 7. Clean Code Development

The clean code pratices followed in this code are :

i. Meaningful Variable and Method Names: 
Choose meaningful and self-explanatory names that convey the purpose of the variable or method.
Example: user_choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))

ii.  Consistent Code Formatting: 
I have maintained consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.

iii. Use of Constants: 
I have used constants to improve code readability.

iv. Encapsulation:
I have created separate class for all functions.

v. User Interaction
Improve user interaction by providing clear prompts and messages.
