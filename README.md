# Library-management-system

This is a simple program on Libaray Management System where we have focused majorly on OOPs concept. It allows users to add books to the library, display available books, borrow a book from the available list of books, return a borrowed book bacK to library and track if a student donates a books to the library.

## Features 

Book management: Add, update, and delete book entries, including details such as title and number of books available 

User Management: Register and maintain username and keep a track of books available in the library while keeping a record of return and issuance of books. 

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

## 4. Analysis Learning unit

1. **Book Management:**
   - Add, update, and remove book from list of the books.
   - Record details such as Books name and username who have borrowed it.

2. **User Management:**
   - Handle borrowing, donation and returns.

3. **Cataloging & Search:**
   - user can see all the listing of the books available in Console.

4. **Borrowing & Returns:**
   - Facilitate the process of lending and returning books.


5. **Reporting & Analytics:**
   - Show all the books issued, borrowed and track all the books availabel in the library.


## 5. DDD (Domain Driven Design)

In domain-driven design (DDD), domains within a system are identified and arranged, the core domain is highlighted, and a strategy design outlining the interactions and mappings between these domains is created. We may find possible domains in the code that is supplied, develop a strategic design, and then document it.

## 7. Clean Code Development

The clean code pratices followed in this code are :

i. Meaningful Variable and Method Names: 
Choose meaningful and self-explanatory names that convey the purpose of the variable or method.
Example: user_choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))

ii.  Consistent Code Formatting: 
I have maintained consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.

iii. Use of Constants: 
I have used constants to improve code readability.

iv. Encapsulation:
I have created separate class for all functions.

v. User Interaction
Improve user interaction by providing clear prompts and messages.
