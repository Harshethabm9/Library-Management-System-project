**Project: Library Management System**

### i. Requirements Identification:
Let's identify a few high-level requirements for our Library Management System:

User Interaction:
          Users should be able to browse available books, borrow books, return books, and donate books.
          
Tracking:
          The system should track books that are borrowed by users.
          

### ii. Jira - Requirements Mapping:

In Jira, we can create user stories and epics:

#### Epic: User Interaction

          User Story 1: As a user, I want to see a list of available books, so I can browse and choose a book to borrow.
          User Story 2: As a user, I want to borrow a book, so I can read it.
          User Story 3: As a user, I want to return a book, so others can borrow it.
          User Story 4: As a user, I want to donate a book to the library.
#### Epic: Tracking
          User Story 5: As a librarian, I want to track books borrowed by users, so I can manage the library inventory.


### iii. Trello - Requirements Mapping:
   
In Trello, we can create boards and cards:
